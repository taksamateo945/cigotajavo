Gonzaga went on a 15-0 run early in the second half and didn't look back to advance to its ninth straight Sweet 16.</p><p>Self said fatigue got the best of his team as they watched their season come to an end, per Fox Sports' <a href=# rel=noopener>Bryan Fischer</a>.</p><p>"My guys were gassed," Self said after the game.</p><p>It was another disappointing ending for Kansas after the Jayhawks won the national championship just two seasons ago. Kansas was not its dominant self this season, finishing sixth in the Big 12 and earning their lowest seed since 2019.</p><p>The Jayhawks snuck past No. 13 Samford 93-89 on Thursday, but the Zags were too much for them in the second round.</p><p>Injuries played a major part in Kansas' early exit. The Jayhawks were <a href=# rel=noopener>without</a> leading scorer Kevin McCullar Jr. after the guard suffered an injury toward the end of the regular season. Kansas was lacking the spark that McCullar likely would have provided had he been healthy.</p><p>Now, Self and the Jayhawks begin preparation for what they hope will be a bounce-back season in 2024.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYWl%2Bd4SMpJinq5GoeqO1y6VkrJ2cm3qisMyiq6xlpKR6rbvOpKCnn12Wtaatw2arqGWemsW1ediemKtlpJqurnnWmqpmn5GowKawjK%2BqZp%2Bfo8eis8A%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./head-of-entertainment-bookings-exits-msge.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>Head Of Entertainment Bookings Exits MSGE</span></a>
