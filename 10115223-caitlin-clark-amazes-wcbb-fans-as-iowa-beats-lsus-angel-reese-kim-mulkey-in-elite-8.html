It wasn't just the shooting, though, as she unleashed perfectly placed passes from beyond half court and consistently set up her teammates when the defense collapsed on her.</p><p>The end result was an 11-point lead for Iowa going into the fourth quarter, and the deficit would have been even worse for LSU if it wasn't for Johnson carrying her team for stretches with impressive play on both ends even though she was in foul trouble.</p><p>Johnson could only do so much, though, and maybe would have had an even bigger impact if LSU head coach Kim Mulkey put her on Clark before the deficit was double digits in the fourth quarter.</p><p>Clark was completely dialed in from the start in a signature performance that will stand out as part of a legendary career. The Tigers never truly threatened in the fourth quarter, Reese fouled out and Clark is now just two wins away from checking off the one thing missing from her resume: a national title.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYWp%2Fc3%2BMnJiirJyeu26vy5qppGWRoq67sdJmrpyakmKzorrSZpisZZmkxKJ5wZ6YratdocC2v4yapaCdnGK%2FprHSnmSkoZ1iura4yp6wZqGeYrKttdOeZHE%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./meet-jack-nicholsons-actress-daughter-2011313.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>Meet Jack Nicholson's Actress Daughter!</span></a>
