Although audiences are sore about Boseman's death, they feel Marvel should consider restoring the role with another actor - and his brother agrees.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/8781c97fdb33bd87.jpg><p class=align-left>Derrick Boseman believes that his deceased brother’s character as the king of Wakanda should be reprised for the sake of its positive influence. Chadwick’s sibling presented that his brother knew the <i>Black Panther </i>was beyond him alone.</p><p class=align-left>Speaking on the superhero’s impact on black youth, Derrick expressed that killing the king off would rob them of someone to look up to. He spoke about the importance of seeing Chadwick’s legacy continue, saying:</p>“Chadwick thought T'Challa was bigger than just himself as one guy. Frankly, Chadwick knew the power of the character, and the positive influence it carries. There's so much power in seeing a black king - especially in a superhero capacity, like in the Marvel flick.”<p class=align-left><strong>PAY ATTENTION:</strong> Never miss breaking news – <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">join</a> Briefly News' Telegram channel!</p><p class=align-left>In his chat with <i><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">TMZ</a></i>, Derrick concluded that although Chadwick didn't communicate that someone else should take on T’Challa, his sentiments would’ve leaned that way. He added that he was certain Chadwick wouldn’t mind, especially since his nephew was so inspired by the hero.</p><h2>Marvel stands firm, won't recast late <i>Black Panther</i> star, Chadwick Boseman</h2><p class=align-left>Earlier, <strong>Briefly News</strong> reported that Marvel had <a href=#>reiterated that they are not looking</a> for a replacement for late <i>Black Panther</i> actor Chadwick Boseman.

It has been reported that the producers of the film aren't interested in entertaining the idea of replacing Chadwick Boseman.</p><p class=align-left>Marvel Cinematic Universe has shared its reasons for not looking to recast the King of Wakanda. According to <i><a href=# title rel="nofollow noopener">Salon</a></i>, <i>Black Panther: Wakanda Forever</i> will focus on T'Challa's sister, Shuri.</p><p class=align-left>Marvel's VP of Development Nate Moore was a guest on the <i>Ringer-Verse </i>podcast recently.
