Jhene Aiko's age is 34 years as of 2022.</p><p class=align-left><strong>PAY ATTENTION</strong>: Follow us on <a id=https://www.instagram.com/brieflynews/ href=# title="Briefly News Instagram" rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a> - get the most important news directly in your favourite app!</p><p class=align-left>Jhene <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Aiko's parents </a>are Christina Yamamoto and Dr Kamaro Chilombo, whose birth name was Gregory Wycliff Barnes. Unfortunately, her parents divorced after 20 years of marriage. But that has not diminished their role in their daughter's <a href=#>music career</a>.</p><h4><strong>What is Jhene Aiko's nationality?</strong></h4><p class=align-left>She <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">is an American </a>though her ethnic identity has always been a cause for confusion for most of her life. She has a mixed ethnicity because her father has African-American, German-Jewish and Native American descent. On the other hand, her mother comes from a long lineage of Dominican, Spanish, and Japanese ancestry.</p><h3>Jhene Aiko's net worth</h3><p class=align-left>According to <a href=#>Celebrity</a> Net Worth in 2022, she is <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">worth $6 million</a>.

After that, she had a series of interconnected contracts with labels like The Ultimate Group, Sony, and Epic Records.</p><p class=align-left>After a long hiatus stemming from an altercation amongst the labels she was signed to and the fact that she got pregnant, Jhene released her first mixtape, titled Sailing Soul, in 2011. In addition, she released her debut EP titled Sailing Out in 2013. The EP was a massive success, showcasing her talent far and wide.</p><p class=align-left>There has been no looking back since then, as she dished out three different albums. The first was in 2014, titled Souled Out; the second was Trip, released in 2017. It was followed by an eponymous album titled Chilombo in 2020.</p><h3>Personal life</h3><p class=align-left>The talented vocalist has been in several romantic relationships that changed her life differently. The first guy publicly romantically linked to the singer was fellow singer O'Ryan Browner, also known as the younger brother of one of America's talented <a href=#>musicians</a>, Omarion.</p><p class=align-left>The duo started dating in 2005 but ended in 2008 because it has remained unrevealed to the general public. However, they had a daughter christened <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Namiko Lee Browner </a>on 19th November 2008 before saying their goodbyes.</p><h4><strong>How old was Jhene Aiko when she had Namiko?</strong></h4><p class=align-left>The singer was 20 years old when she gave birth to her first child. Jhene Aiko's partner was Bow Wow and later Childish Gambino after breaking up with O'Ryan, but none of them were confirmed.</p><h4><strong>Who did Jhene Aiko marry?</strong></h4><p class=align-left>In 2016, news began to filter into the online space that Efuru had <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">married Dot Da Genius</a>, whose real name is Oladipo Omishore. They dated for a year before she walked down the aisle, but it soon became apparent that it would not work.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/9d5eb0dce573dd05.jpg><p class=align-left>She filed for a divorce in 2008 and cited irreconcilable differences as the reason for it.</p><h3>Who is Jhene Aiko currently with?</h3><p class=align-left>The <i>Souled Out</i> album-maker<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> is in</a> a serious relationship with a famous American musician named Big Sean. She has been open about her confession of love for him during different interviews. The duo were friends for several years despite her relationships at the time. Eventually, they took it to a romantic level in 2016 after Jhene divorced Dot Da Genius.</p><p class=align-left>The relationship hit its first rock bottom in 2018 when they were rumoured to have split, and it was confirmed in 2019. Fast forward to 2020, after a series of flirting and supportive posts on each other's social media accounts, they confirmed that they were back together.</p><h4><strong>Is Big Sean married to Jhene?</strong></h4><p class=align-left>The lovebirds are <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">yet to</a> the knot formally. They announced through their respective social media pages that they would welcome a child soon.</p><p class=align-left>Jhene Aiko's <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">children will be two </a>whenever she gives birth, as she already has a 13-year-old daughter from one of her previous relationships.</p><p class=align-left>Jhene Aiko's net worth may not be topping the list of highest earners in the American music industry, but she is comfortable enough to invest in real estate.
