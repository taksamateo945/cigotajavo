The twist here is that you’re trying to identify a specific country. The game offers a silhouette of a random country in the world and asks players to type in their guess as to which country it is.&nbsp;If the player is wrong, the game literally them in the right direction. Yes, <strong>Worldle</strong> slowly tells users how far away the correct country is from their guess and in what direction. The only major downside is that <strong>Worldle</strong> is almost impossible to find via Google since it is one letter off from <strong>Wordle</strong>. Players who find the game are in for a treat, but those who can’t will get an equivalent experience with <strong>Globle</strong>.</p><p><strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Play Worldle Here</a></strong></p><h2><strong>Dungleon</strong></h2><p>Most Wordle-like games are based on the idea of finding something that already exists. That something could be a word, a movie title, a song, or a country, but whatever you’re trying to discover is usually some kind of established concept. <strong>Dungleon</strong> plays with that objective in interesting ways.</p><p>In <strong>Dungleon</strong>, players aren’t supposed to guess the correct word but instead arrange pixelated tokens in the correct order. These pictures include fantasy staples such as treasure chests, wizards, skeletons, and knights, and, as is <strong>Wordle</strong> tradition, <strong>Dungleon</strong> highlights which tokens are in the right or wrong spot. As usual, players also have six tries, but <strong>Dungleon</strong> also throws users a bone and gives them the option to either remove a picture that doesn’t belong or highlight one that does. In an internet full of <strong>Wordle</strong> wannabes, <strong>Dungleon</strong>‘s unique takes on the basics of the <strong>Wordle</strong> concept help it stand out.</p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Play Dungleon Here</strong></a></p><h2><strong>Quordle</strong></h2><p>What’s harder than a game that tasks you with finding a five-letter word in only six guesses? A game with four times as many secret words with only a few more guesses to work with.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8yoraKdXa%2B8r7GOamxmmpWowW7DzqubpZ1dmLmwusSsZJ%2BnomLGsMHRZpuaoZyueqitzJ5kp52VmcBw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./person-who-might-wear-heavy-eyeliner-and-black-lipstick-html.html><span>←</span><span>Person who might wear heavy eyeliner and black lipstick</span></a>
