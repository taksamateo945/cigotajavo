Mr. Jones' B-sample is currently being analyzed by the independent WADA-accredited laboratory in Salt Lake City, Utah, and we have requested that the laboratory report those results to us as soon as possible. While at this time we are not going to provide any further specifics of the case, I can tell you that Mr. Jones will be provided full due process under the rules.</p><p>I can also confirm that USADA has been in communication with the Nevada State Athletic Commission regarding Mr. Jones' potential violation and that we are working to ensure that the Commission has the necessary information to fully adjudicate this matter in accordance with its rules.</p><p>On Friday, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">SportsCenter</a> reported Jones' B Sample tested positive as well.&nbsp;</p><p>The setback is a major one for Jones, who appeared to be reviving his career following a unanimous-decision victory over Ovince Saint Preux at UFC 197 in April. The fight represented Jones' first action in the Octagon after he received a one-year ban stemming from a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">felony hit-and-run charge</a>.</p><p>And according to UFC president <a href=#>Dana White</a>, more discipline could be on the way.</p><h3 class=streamElement></h3><p lang=en>"Jones might get two years for this," White said Wednesday evening during a meeting with reporters, per Yahoo Sports' <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dan Wetzel</a>.</p><p lang=en><span>As for Cormier, losing Jones as an adversary Saturday evening in Las Vegas deprives him of a chance to exact revenge.
