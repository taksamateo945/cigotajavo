They're supposed to be ugly. Look at the <a href=#>Bruins'</a> old alternate jersey. And that thing was on an Original Six team!</p><p>What I'm getting at is that alternate jerseys are usually much worse than the usual jerseys. And these things remained alternate jerseys, at least for now. They actually became the Thrashers' home uniforms (more on those later).</p><p>Speaking of tradition, the Thrashers added a tie around the neck to these abominations. You know, for the players if they want to suffocate themselves for appearing in these things.</p><p>Not only was the tie unnecessary, but apparently the design team was trying to add a more traditional look to these new-wave eyesores.</p><p>Another thing: You can't really see it in the picture, but the triangles-inside-the-lower-stripe thing is back. It's just another bad part to this abhorrent uniform.</p><p>I wonder who thought just one sleeve would be the best place to put a wordmark. I mean really, did the design meeting go something like this:</p><p>MARKETING EXEC 1: "Okay, we need to make a splash in the NHL. A jersey no one has ever seen before."</p><p>MARKETING EXEC 2: "I got an idea! How 'bout we change the color scheme from navy blue to light blue. Because, y'know, we're named after a bird called the Brown Thrasher. And get this: asymmetry. Just the word "Atlanta" plastered on the left sleeve. Instantly the greatest jersey ever."</p><p>MARKETING EXEC 3: "Um, Johnson, that really wouldn't look very good."</p><p>MARKETING EXEC 2: "Who cares? We're making a brand new jersey for a baseball team that just joined the league a few years ago. It needs any sort of attention it can get. There's no such thing as bad publicity."</p><p>MARKETING EXEC 3: "Johnson, you do realize that the Thrashers are a hockey team. And baseball sleeves aren't long enough to put "Atlanta" on them."</p><p>MARKETING EXEC 2: "Baseball, hockey same thing. Who cares? Now, who wants more cocaine?"</p><p>Though these only lasted one season, this wasn't Atlanta's last run-in with asymmetry.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJobmtoYGeEbq3TpZinrJFiwam%2BwKyfnqqjYsGpsYyjnKurla7AbsDHnmSnoJxixLDBy52tnmWSmrKvecGeq62domK8p7KMsKCtoJ%2BqwQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./birthday.html><span>←</span><span>July 9 Famous Birthdays - All Famous Birthdays</span></a>
