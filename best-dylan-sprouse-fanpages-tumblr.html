However, Dylan Sprouce’s&nbsp;fans certainly haven’t forgotten about him&nbsp;and the star-studded actor he once was. &nbsp;Many of Dylan Sprouse’s fans have used the popular blogging cite, Tumblr, to create elaborate fan pages expressing their love. &nbsp;While some of the pages are no longer being frequently updated, they all serve as a tribute to one of the guys who showed the world how to enjoy the suite life. &nbsp;Here are the best Dylan Sprouse fan pages on Tumblr.</p><p>The creator of this blog welcomes visitors with this short and simple message: “Welcome to my blog! I’m Turkish. I love Dylan Sprouse, Miley Cyrus and Selena Gomez &lt;3″ The Fatmanur page, also known as, Dylan Sprouse Love, wastes no time showing just how dedicated its members are. &nbsp;As soon as viewers enter the site they are greeted with a definition of what it means to be a fan that proves exactly why the word is short for fanatic: ”</p><p>She cries every night thinking of you.</p><p>She smiles when she hears you.</p><p>She supports you no matter what you do or who you date.</p><p>She defends you when a person calls you lame.<br>She’s a “weird girl” at school because of her obsession.<br>She stays awake all night for a new video or a new song.<br>She lives miles away from you.<br>She would give anything to get a hug.<br>She listens to your songs all day.<br>She has a blog about you and spends her day on it.<br>She reads stories about you.<br>She tweets you everyday and feels avoided when she sees you answer other people but not her.<br>She annoys her friends because she never stops talking about you.<br>She has a room full of posters.<br>She writes your name everywhere.”</p><p>Apparently, these are just the kind of fans that Dylan Sprouse attracts.</p><p>The S3xyDylan (yes, that is a three instead of an e) Tumblr page is dedicated to Dylan Sprouse and proudly declares “Dylan Sprouse is sexy” on its main page. &nbsp;The blog, which features&nbsp;a background made entirely of McDonald’s Big Macs, currently has&nbsp;102 pages of Sprouse related content including screenshots, GIFs, and memes. &nbsp;The page also has numerous selfies taken by fan across the world who were lucky enough to have a real-life&nbsp;run in with Dylan</p><p>For those of you who may have been wondering, “This is not the real Dylan and Cole Sprouse but only a fan made blog.” &nbsp;Now that that’s cleared up, visitors are free to enjoy the many pictures and GIFs that depict Dylan and his brother throughout their careers. &nbsp;The page also features the song “Welcome to the Tipton” that was&nbsp;originally served as a commercial for The Suit Life of Zack and Cody’s fictitious hotel.</p><p>This page isn’t just for people who are fans of Dylan Sprouse; it is for people who are addicted to him. &nbsp;While the blog also includes pictures and GIFs of other celebrities, the blog’s creator makes it clear that her loyalties lie when Dylan Sprouse and One Direction. &nbsp;Although the site contains mostly images, it also features a statement that was supposedly written by Dylan addressing all of the criticism he received after he decided to shave his hair into a mohawk. &nbsp;Many of Dylan’s face did not find the hairstyle flattering and did not hesitate to tell him; however, Dylan remained calm and in his statement he made sure to politely let people know their opinions don’t phase him. &nbsp;After rehashing some of the conversations he had after he cut his hair, Dylan said: “Hair is hair. It grows back. Mine grows back particularly fast. Cole and I have always had odd hairstyles to say the least. This is historically accurate lol. Not only that, but hair is very much an expression of yourself. Keyword expression. I implore everyone to experiment with their hair, as not only is it fun, but it is liberating in many ways to stray away from the social norm.”</p><p>This page is sure to announce that only “Dylan Sprouse lovers” are admitted. &nbsp;Although this secret Sprouse society has been fairly inactive for a while, it’s content is certainly centered around Dylan and his many acting roles. &nbsp;This page is filled with images of Dylan and Cole, and thanks&nbsp;to sites&nbsp;like this, the young stars will always be able to look back at some of the best moments during their Suite Life days and era.</p><p>&nbsp;(Photo by Tim Whitby/Getty Images)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCtp5%2BXe6S7zGiZnqukYrG6uMCnZKyooqTCtLGMn5inqJGcsrR5066km6SiZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./gary-busey.html><span>←</span><span>Gary Busey Net Worth, Age, Height, Bio, Birthday, Wiki!</span></a>
