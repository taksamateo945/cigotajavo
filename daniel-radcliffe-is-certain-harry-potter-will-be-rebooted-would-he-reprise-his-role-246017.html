Rowling.</p><p>‘I’m sure there will be some version of it; I know I am not the last Harry Potter I am gonna see in my lifetime. It’ll be very interesting to see how long those films stay…it feels like there is a sacredness around them at the moment, but that will go, the shine will just wear off at some point. It will be interesting if they reboot them and just do the films again or do a series; I am fascinated to watch.’</p><p>Since he is so interested in watching a revival or remake of the successful stories with a new Harry Potter, that means that the British actor has no intention of reprising his role.</p><p>Furthermore, Radcliffe acknowledged that some directors might hesitate to cast him in a different franchise just because he is so widely associated with Harry Potter and people could have a hard time seeing him as any other character.</p><p>When asked what he would be interested in being part of, he dished that ‘Any project that the script is good, I would be into. I can completely understand why some directors might be hesitant about putting me into a franchise because I have a lot of baggage from another franchise, so I can see why that would make people not want to do that necessarily. But I would be very happy to.’</p><p>Daniel has not been part of the Harry Potter world ever since wrapping up the last movie back in 2010.</p><p>That being said, he even previously admitted to Seth Meyers that he is not planning on watching the play, Harry Potter and the Cursed Child either!</p><p>The reason is that he would not want to be watched by the audience to see his reaction.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>But a reboot series? It sounds like Daniel Radcliffe is all for enjoying that in the comfort of his own home!</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeUlruqsctmqZqck6G2p7LEZqCsZZOav7WtyKdkoZmip8ZuvM6tq56qXay2rbiMm5xmqpWXvLDAxJ1ksKelobFutMRmqZ6oop7ApnnHoqpmqp%2Bhsm5%2Bk29nam9f</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kuwtk-kim-kardashian-reportedly-gets-restraining-order-against-stranger-who-sent-her-an-engagement-ring-amid-kanye-west-divorce-494168.html><span>←</span><span>KUWTK: Kim Kardashian Reportedly Gets Restraining Order Against Stranger Who Sent Her An Engagement</span></a>
