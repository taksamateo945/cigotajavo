<span>Aldo Pusey</span></p><h1>Taylor Swift Inspired New Hot Chelle Rae Song; Brandi Cyrus Sings</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>The guys of Hot Chelle Rae will stay up all night in the name of a good time! Their new song "Don't Say Goodnight" draws inspiration from their many nights on tour with superstars <a href=#><strong>Justin Bieber</strong></a> and <strong><a href=#>Taylor Swift</a>.</strong> "We have had so many experiences and almost all of them come from you forcing yourself to go out and really live," <strong>Nash Overstreet</strong>, the band's lead guitarist, tells Us Weekly. "When we force ourselves to go out, that's when all the cool stuff happens; that's when all the memories get made."</p><p>Hot Chelle Rae's lead singer <strong>Ryan Follesé</strong>, 27, recalls one night in particular when the guys passed on tucking themselves into bed. “It was one of my favorite tour moments ever. We were on tour in Australia with Taylor, and one night she rented a beautiful yacht and invited our band and managers to join her band and managers to cruise Sydney Harbor. We ate Argentinean barbecue and drove around for hours that night. We were all out there drinking, dancing, and playing our favorite music," the crooner reminisces. "It was one of the most beautiful, fun nights we've ever had!"</p><p><a href=#>PHOTOS: Taylor Swift's best surprised faces</a></p><p>Overstreet, who is the brother of Glee star <a href=#><strong>Chord Overstreet</strong></a>, recruited another celebrity's sibling to assist with "Don't Say Goodnight" — <a href=#><strong>Miley Cyrus</strong>'</a> older, half-sister, <strong>Brandi</strong>! "We were sitting in the studio in Hollywood and I, as a joke, had done this little 'you can't rap' thing in the song, but it sounded like a chipmunk, so we were like, 'We need a girl with some attitude to get in here!'" the guitarist, 28, explains. "I had talked to Brandi earlier that day about doing something and she ended up doing that and some of the chorus as well. It was a lot of fun!"</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>With pals like Taylor Swift and Brandi Cyrus, it's easy to see why the guys of Hot Chelle Rae wouldn't want to call it an early night.
