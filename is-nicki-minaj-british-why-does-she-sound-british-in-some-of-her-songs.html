Minaj gave a fantastic Adele impression while in the notorious automobile, leaving many baffled as to how she picked up the accent.</p><h2 id=h-carpool-karaoke-is-back-in-style>Carpool Karaoke is back in style</h2><p>Due to restrictions in the pandemic, the Late Late Show had to remove the popular segment from the show to keep everyone safe. But it’s finally back to the excitement of viewers, and fans of the celebrity guests.</p><p>In a previous episode, Adele did a rendition of Minaj’s verse from the Kanye West song ‘Monster’, which Nicki also performed in the segment, creating one of the best mashups in recent history.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>THE <a href=#>@NICKIMINAJ</a> X <a href=#>@ADELE</a> MONSTER DUET THE WORLD DESERVES <a href=#>#NICKICARPOOL</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/r2aek32nH4</a></p><p>— The Late Late Show with James Corden (@latelateshow) <a href=#>April 7, 2022</a></p><p>This instalment of Carpool Karaoke shows Nicki as the queen of rap, but also a more vulnerable side to her as she talks about anxiety and the pressure as a public figure.</p><p>Between cackles and iconic verses, she shared that as a woman in the public eye you’re constantly scrutinised for your choices and actions, and that it does impact your mental health.</p><p>She explained how she now no longer has the sense of freedom that she did when she first started her career in rap.</p><p>Despite the sincere and charming moments from Minaj, she still kept the energy up during the drive, including playing the clarinet and cracking jokes alongside Corden.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>.<a href=#>@nickiminaj</a> teaching James about "ops" is one of the most important things ever captured on film <a href=#>#NICKICARPOOL</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/VwZcj4vjHX</a></p><p>— The Late Late Show with James Corden (@latelateshow) <a href=#>April 7, 2022</a></p><p>The full segment is available on YouTube,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">watch here.</a></p><h2 id=h-is-nicki-minaj-british>Is Nicki Minaj British?</h2><p>After watching Carpool Karaoke, a lot of people picked up on Nicki’s Adele impersonation. Many were surprised at how well she could imitate a British accent, including Corden himself, as well as fans online.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>THE BRITISH ACCENT 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 WE ALL KNOW <a href=#>@NICKIMINAJ</a> IS THE QUEEN OF ENGLAND <a href=#>#NickiCarpool</a> <a href=#>#CarpoolKaraoke</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/D4vn6Ga99f</a></p><p>— uncle Fabio 🇮🇹 (@onikamajesty) <a href=#>April 7, 2022</a></p><p>Despite the good impression, Nicki isn’t British. In fact, she was&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">born in the Caribbean</a>, before moving to Queens, New York at the age of 5.</p><p>Throughout her career, she’s kept a strong connection to her Trinidadian roots, with her style and aspects of her music videos, for example dressing in festival attire in Pound The Alarm.</p><p>Before her music career took off, she worked a number of waitressing jobs. One of these included a Red Lobster in the Bronx, which she was fired from for&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">discourtesy to customers</a>. Minaj also revealed this was an issue that lost her a few jobs in her late teens and early adult life.</p><p>However, she spoke about her jobs on a podcast with RuPaul Charles and Michelle Visage, saying that the money she earned from waitressing&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">helped her to buy a BMW</a>.</p><h2 id=h-this-isn-t-the-first-time-nicki-minaj-does-a-british-accent>This isn’t the first time Nicki Minaj does a British accent</h2><p>For long time fans of Minaj, you’d know this isn’t the first time she’s done a British accent.</p><p>Nicki has a whole roster of alter egos within her music, including an ‘inner demon’ named Roman Zolanski.</p><p>Another ego that she has is the mother of Roman, Martha. Martha speaks with a British accent, which can be heard in several songs, especially in the opening to ‘Roman Holiday’, the opening track from her 2012 album Pink Friday… Roman Reloaded.</p><p>However, she has pulled out the accent in different situations too. In one instance, Minaj sends a message to British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, joking that she was in fact born in the UK, and even went to university with former PM Margaret Thatcher.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>🇬🇧 🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧 send this to the prime minister & let him know they lied on me.
