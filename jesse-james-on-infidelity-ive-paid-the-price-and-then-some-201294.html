I don’t know anybody anywhere that’s had to endure what I had to endure for basically infidelity,” the 42-year-old says. “It’s just the nature of my life. People always will want me sainted one minute, and strung up the next.”</p><p>While Bullock has said little about their June 2010 divorce (and the events that preceded it), James has done countless interviews explaining his bad boy behavior.</p><p>“I stood up like a man and admitted my wrongs and what I did and all that did is make every sh-t tabloid everywhere across the world come after me even harder,” James says. “I’m strong. I can take it. Everybody can take cheap shots and say I’m a horrible dad, and that I’m a Nazi, and all this other bullsh-t. Give me all you got. Because you know what? I know inside what kind of a person I am. I know I’m an awesome dad. I’m devoted to my work. And I work hard to take care of my family.”</p><p>(James is father to daughter <strong>Sunny</strong>, 8, with porn star ex-wife <strong>Janine Lindemulder</strong>; he also has two kids with with first wife <strong>Karla James</strong>.)</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>According to James, he struggled with his public image long before he wed Bullock, 47, on July 16, 2005.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“My older brother was gay, and looked just like me, and happened to die of HIV five years ago. Nobody ever cared to ask about that,” James tells <a href=#>Yahoo’s OMG!</a>. “I think people just judge me by the way I look. That predates fame or any of that stuff. People have always been scared of me and always think I’m a bigot or a racist or a homophobe just by the way I look. I’m 6’3″, and 215 pounds, [and a] tattooed-up white boy. It fits a criminal or whatever. They don’t realize.”</p><p>James, who is 12 years sober, adds that he’s not proud of his philandering ways and the pain it caused his ex-wife and girlfriend <strong>Kat</strong> <strong>Von</strong> <strong>D</strong>, 30.</p><p>“I think people will probably think since I’m doing well now and since I’m happy that I don’t have any sorrow or regret for what I did, which couldn’t be further from the truth. There’ll never be a day that goes by for the rest of my life that I don’t regret it,” James admits. “If I could go back and change the way I did things, and not hurt people, and not do things the way I did, of course I would do it that way. I would never consciously bring pain to anyone, especially the people I love. It is something that I have to live with.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKGeq6OaequtzJ6qZqeeYravssidnKWhpK56qsLEZqeaoZRiwamxjKmpopuVYq6vsIytn56mXai8rrGMa2dqamlp</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./john-goodmans-character-on-the-conners-html.html><span>←</span><span>John Goodman's character on The Conners</span></a>
