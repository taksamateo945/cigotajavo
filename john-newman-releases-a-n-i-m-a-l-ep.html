These four very personal songs are really close to my heart and have carried me through some hard times.</p><p>“The EP deals with themes such as the unnecessary pressures we put ourselves under, struggles with mental health and the power of love to conquer all. The process also reminded me why I love writing and recording and releasing music and made me realise how lucky I am to have this creative outlet.”</p><p>Listen to the&nbsp;A.N.i.M.A.L.&nbsp;EP below.</p><p>This EP follows on from John’s acoustic&nbsp;<a href=#>Out of the Blue</a>&nbsp;EP which was unveiled following his successful tour of the same name.
