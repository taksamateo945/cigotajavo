Our friendship and our daughter is priority,’ the KUWK star tweeted.</p><p>In the meantime, Travis addressed the breakup from another point of view, assuring everyone that there was no infidelity, amid rumors that he cheated on Kylie.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>‘Once again, the false stories about me cheating are simply not true.
