<span>Martina Birk</span></p><h1>Miesha Tate And Johnny Nunez Were Blessed With A Baby Boy During The Pandemic</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><strong>MMA fighters Miesha Tate and her husband, Johnny Nunez</strong>, had a son during the epidemic.&nbsp;Tate, who had the opportunity to relive the feeling of becoming a mother, turned to Instagram to share the news with her admirers and followers.&nbsp;At the same time, the ex-UFC champion shocked fans by revealing that her kid was delivered at home, in the toilet. Fans couldn’t help but admire her bravery in giving delivery at home.</p><h2>A Surprising Birth!</h2><p>On June 14, 2020, the mother of two came to Instagram to publish a series of photos, the first of which showed the family gathering around what seemed to be their bathroom to welcome the newest member of their family.&nbsp;While the new parents were clearly distressed after such a traumatic incident, the newborn’s older sister, Amaia, kept an eye on everything while still in diapers. Tate mentioned in the caption how fantastic it was to go through delivery for the second time. Despite the couple’s hopes for hospital delivery, their baby boy had other ideas.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Miesha-Tate-2.jpg alt="Miesha Tate" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>Miesha Tate and her husband have revealed the name of their son.</h2><p>She revealed her son’s name to the public, announcing that Daxton Wylder Nuez was born in their house at 8:20 a.m. on June 14, 2020.&nbsp;She also reiterated that they accepted Daxton as a member of their family and that it was a wonderfully imperfect turn of circumstances.&nbsp;Regardless, she said that she was “overjoyed.” In the last paragraph, she expressed her gratitude to her adoring husband, who had consoled and inspired her throughout the ordeal.</p><h2>Miesha Tate Was Appreciative of Her Husband</h2><p>“I can’t thank you @johnnyboymma enough,” she started. “You kept me concentrated and focused, and you assisted me in unexpectedly delivering our baby! I honestly couldn’t have done it without you. Thank you for being my pillar of strength.”</p><p>The carousel then showed Tate and her husband’s youngest child’s face; the doting father establishing skin-to-skin contact with his newborn boy; and the infant’s sibling clutching onto his hand as he slept. Fans and well-wishers raced to the comments section after the pro-MMA fighter gave her side of the tale to congratulate the second-time parents and commend the pro-athlete for her courageous home birth.</p><p>“You go, mother! It’s a stunning sight to see! Congratulations on your unexpected at-home natural delivery!!! “A user was overjoyed. “Wow… I didn’t realize your kid was born at home. Wasn’t that intense? “another piece of writing, “You and your hubby are wonderful people!!! God bless you and your family, and I can’t wait to see you fight again!!!!!”</p><h2>It was the husband’s Decision.</h2><p>Tate’s husband told ONEFC following the birth of their child, “It’s great to be a parent, but it’s better to have your own.” His daughter Amaia was born after three-day labor, although this time was much quicker.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Miesha-Tate-3.jpg alt="Miesha Tate" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Nunez didn’t call an ambulance since the baby’s head had already been crowned.<br>Instead, he decided to take the initiative and prepare for delivery.&nbsp;“Amaia was the most ecstatic,” the delighted father remarked. “She had previously expressed a desire to hold her little brother!”</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGikop2jna5uwMCtnGaZnpl6q7vHp6WyZZ6qu6bGjLCcq51dl7mmv9Kem2avmam1bq2Mm5ibsV8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-daniela-nieves-boyfriend-rumored-to-be-dating-tyler-perez-ethnicity-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Who Is Daniela Nieves Boyfriend?
