And contrary to popular belief, we never dated or anything.”</p><p>When asked about Rocko, her ex-boyfriend, father of sons Rodney and Romelo; she gave a very ambiguous answer by saying: “We been apart for ten years, and over the last few, I would say over the last six months, he really has become one of my best friends. Because see what people don’t understand is, when you raise kids together, stuff starts going in stages.”</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B_gOjy3DuMH/</p><p>T.I. interjected: “Y’all meant for each other. I think y’all the only ones that can handle one another type.”</p><p>Monica went on to reveal that Rocko is in a relationship and added: “He’s in a relationship, and we have not dealt with each other at all in 10 and a half years.”</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B_gE3vqDk9A/</p><p>She went to reveal what she is looking for in a man: “It does not have to be somebody famous at all. It definitely has to be somebody though that can handle what fame brings. I really want somebody that can be the head and not the tail because I like to be led, but I love to be led right. You handle it! I gotta do that on my job. I gotta orchestrate, handle, tell people what to do, what time to do it, how to do it, which way I want it done. I don’t want to do that at home. Please take over!”</p><p>She went on to say: “I’m proud of what my marriage was. It lasted nine years, and I have an amazing daughter. I learned a lot, and I lived a lot, I wasn’t looking for anything when we met. I hadn’t heard of him. I didn’t know who he was. My boys were super small, so I wasn’t watching sports. I didn’t know who he was at all. But it happened because it was supposed to happen.”</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Will Monica get back with Rocko?</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGedpLuqr8BmqZ6ulZa5tHnIn2SsoJVixLDBy51knZmkmnqpsdFmmZqaqWKxorDDsmSrp5OgvG670WasrKCVp3qiusNmq2ahXai1or7ErGShoaNivLG1zaKmp2Vjbn55gJdo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ali-fedotowsky-and-roberto-martinez-hooked-up-at-ashley-heberts-wedding-to-jp-rosenbaum-20121312.html><span>←</span><span>Ali Fedotowsky and Roberto Martinez Hooked Up at Ashley Hebert's Wedding to J.P.
