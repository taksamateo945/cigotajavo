When you either are or were going to be a part of a documentary on Michael Jackson and Russell Simmons, how is that not making it all about them?”</p><p>She continued with: “Interestingly, Brother M.J. was acquitted, and deceased, so how is he not off-limits? Russell and Harvey are accused of the same thing, so in fairness, how do you not ‘support’ the accusers of both, as you said you did with R.S., or [did] you look for the silver lining for both like you said you did for H.W.?”</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B7MP6Fihta0/</p><p>Mo’Nique went on to share her “personal experience” with Oprah by writing: “You’ve watched me as a black woman, be accused of being difficult for not promoting Precious internationally for Lions Gate, at Lions Gate, Tyler Perry, and your request, despite the fact my deal was with Lee Daniels Entertainment. How are you for black women when you hear Tyler on audio saying I was right and he was going to speak up, but you or he still haven’t said a word?”</p><p>The Precious star added: “My sixteen-year-old self didn’t know that you, in your silence in the face of wrongdoing, would make my life ‘harder.’ Lastly, please consider standing by the people who are right and not just the ‘right people.'”</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B7q2sjAB5Tg/</p><p>Reactions to the message were mixed at best. This person said: “Monique is not healed from this! 😢She couldn’t have shot her a text or email or handwritten letter?”</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B8H9I_VhnRu/</p><p>One follower stated: “Oprah really forgot her roots 🤦🏽‍♂️, but nobody is responsible for your actions but you. Keep that in mind.”</p><p>A third comment read: “A (well-deserved) read. Oprah’s actions and words aren’t adding up, and Mo’Nique just brought out the calculator.”</p><p>The fourth commenter shared: “Monique is always speaking facts, but other folks don’t be ready for her conversation.”</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Oprah and Mo’Nique have been involved in this bitter feud since working on Precious in 2009.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGedpLuqvdSeZJyZnKHAbrvUrWSoqKKWtW6yzqtkm52Zo7RurYyhsKmnk6e2tbGMn6arZaSdsrSxjKaYp7Fdp7Kiv86nqmZrZmuAdYCO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ryleigh-claire-20080429-html.html><span>←</span><span>Ryleigh Claire (Model) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</span></a>
