On Monday, February 28, Universal Music Group announced that it had purchased Diamond’s complete music collection and the publication rights to her compositions. This package contains songs, masters, and music videos, as well as an unreleased album and about 110 unpublished tracks. According to Variety, the deal will also cover future ways the singer may record.</p><p>According to a UMG news release, Diamond commented,</p><p>“After over a decade in business with UMG, I am grateful for the trust and respect that we have developed together, and I am certain that…the worldwide team at UMG will continue to represent my collection, and future releases, with the same enthusiasm and integrity that has always fuelled my career.”</p><h2>A look into Neil Diamond’s net worth</h2><p>Neil Diamond is valued at between $175 and $300 million, according to figures compiled from several outlets. Diamond’s vast wealth is attributed to his work as a Grammy-winning singer, which has resulted in over 130 million worldwide sales records. According to reports, the artist has sold 49.5 million records in the United States. The 81-year-old singer-songwriter has 53 songs on the Billboard Hot 100 list, with almost 13 of them hitting the top ten. At the same time, the list includes three of his songs that reached number one. You Don’t Bring Me Flowers, Cracklin’ Rosie, and Song Sung Blue is among this album’s songs.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Neil-Diamond-2.jpg alt="Neil Diamond" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Diamond was also ranked 25th on Billboard’s list of the “Greatest Artists of All Time” in 2019. The RIAA has classified 20 albums in his musical collection as Platinum successes throughout his 60-year career. Diamond’s albums, such as The Jazz Singer from the 1980s, have been certified Platinum by the RIAA five times. Meanwhile, his compilation albums, such as 12 Greatest Hits Vol. II and The Greatest Hits: 1966–1992 were certified Platinum by the RIAA in the United States three times.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Neil-Diamond-3.jpg alt="Neil Diamond " width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Neil Diamond has seven acting credits in addition to his considerable singing career. He has also worked on the music for eight other projects. Regarding real estate, the singing icon owns Blue Whale Estates in Malibu, which he allegedly purchased in 2017 for a whopping $7.35 million. While the price of his latest contract with UMG has not yet been made public, Diamond will likely profit from the sale. Diamond, 81, has Parkinson’s disease, which may result in his wealth being distributed to his heirs after his death.</p><p></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Neil Diamond</a> <a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Neil Diamond net worth</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGilnqGcYrGqrcyopZ1lmqrAtXnArpqtoZ%2BjsqV5zp%2BdZqCZqHq0u82gZJyZpJa5sLOO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ethan-crumbley-latest-missing-parents-of-oxford-high-school-shooter-found-after-going-on-the-run.html><span>←</span><span>Ethan Crumbley latest Missing parents of Oxford High School shooter found after going o</span></a>
