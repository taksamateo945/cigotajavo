Straight-legs, mom jeans and Abercrombie & Fitch? No, you didn’t just time travel back to the ’90s, even though this collection will make you feel like you did. I was only a tween when Abercrombie & Fitch was all the rage, but I remember it well. While many may think of the dark-fitting rooms, photos of shirtless models and the smell of cologne in the air, I also used to associate the store with clothes I just couldn’t squeeze into, no matter how hard I tried."><meta name=author content="Reinaldo Massengill"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

No, you didn’t just time travel back to the ’90s, even though this collection will make you feel like you did.</p><p>I was only a tween when <a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Abercrombie & Fitch</a> was all the rage, but I remember it well. While many may think of the dark-fitting rooms, photos of shirtless models and the smell of cologne in the air, I also used to associate the store with clothes I just couldn’t squeeze into, no matter how hard I tried.</p><p>You’ll note, I say “used to” associate — and I’m happy that it is in the past tense.</p><p>Introducing Abercrombie & Fitch’s new <a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Curve Love collection</a>, which really hits the nail on the head with how I felt about the jeans and the company’s new and long overdue mission. Not only for plus-sized people, the Curve Love denim collection spans a multitude of sizes, from a 23 to a 37 with options for extra short, short, regular and long lengths, too.</p><p>Seeing this, I knew I had to bury the hatchet with the brand and start fresh, ordering the new collection in every color and style. I had the pleasure of trying the 90s Ultra High Rise Straight Leg Jeans, High Rise Mom Jeans, High Rise Dad Jeans, Ultra High Rise Ankle Jeans and a pair of High Rise Skinny Jeans (don’t tell <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Gen Z on me, please</a>.)</p><h2>The collection as a whole</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/09/background-denim.jpg><p>Before diving into the specifics of each pair, I wanted to share some overall notes about the jeans, should you also have shared in my past experiences and want to try A&F again.</p><p>To start, the first thing I noticed before even putting them on was the quality of the denim. These feel like the pair of pants you’ll have for ages, as the material feels super sturdy and thick. Many of the pairs in the collection are made from A&F Vintage Stretch Denim, which is the most rigid, the A&F All Day Comfort Stretch Denim which is the middle level or the most stretchy A&F Signature Stretch Denim. You will feel a difference as you continue to wear them throughout the day, but no matter which you choose, the quality can be seen and felt.</p><p>Next up was the actual fit of the jeans, which is arguably the whole point of the review. While I’ll get into specifics in a moment, I did find that throughout the collection, they very much do fit true to size. I opted to size up one size from my favorite skinny jeans, and while I was glad I did for my own comfort, many looser styles like the <a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">High Rise Mom Jeans</a> and the <a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Ultra High Rise Ankle Jeans</a> would have fit in my normal size for sure. Since the fabric does mold to your body throughout the day, expect the tighter waistband to loosen up and any baggy style to get just a bit baggier with wear.</p><p>If you’re ready to dive in and start shopping, hit that button below and show your curves some love. Otherwise, keep scrolling for a breakdown of the collection and a first-person review of each of the trending styles.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/09/abercrombie-1.jpg><p>These may be the best of the collection, so we’re putting it at the top of this review.</p><p>The ’90s style is a great one to appease Gen Z, who have an affinity for wide-leg pants, but also to speak to the millennials that started the trend. I personally loved the ultra high-rise fit, coming up over my belly button and slimming everything from the waist down.</p><p>The fabric is one of the stiffer ones, made from A&F Vintage Stretch Denim that I personally love, since my biggest pet peeve is when jeans are too flimsy and show every line and roll on my body. These also hold up during a full day’s wear, not stretching out too much in the waistband or showing signs of falling down sans a belt. On the flip side, the waistband is pretty tight, which is why I sized up one size.</p><ul><li>I got a size 32, one size higher than normal for a more comfortable fit in the waistband. Size ranges from 23 to 37 and lengths include extra short, short, regular and long.</li><li>Colors available: light wash, dark wash, ripped light wash and ripped black.</li><li>A&F Vintage Stretch Denim for a stiffer feel and less stretch.</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/09/curve-love.jpg><p>These ain’t your mama’s jeans. Unless your mother is ultra-fashionable, then feel free to share these with her.</p><p>I love Mom jeans because I have a higher waist on a short torso and then a wider set of hips moving down. Since they have a snug waistband but then a wide fit in the rest of the pants, these are perfect on me.</p><p>I wore these all day running errands and they did stretch out a bit, so I should have stuck with my normal size 31 instead of sizing up, but it was nothing a belt couldn’t fix. They are made of the softer A&F All Day Comfort Stretch Denim fabric, so this made sense and the trade-off is that you get a comfy and lighter-weight pair for running around.</p><ul><li>I got a size 32, one size higher than normal, but should have stuck with my normal size. Size ranges from 23 to 37 and lengths include extra short, short, regular and long.</li><li>Colors available: light ripped wash, medium wash, medium wash, ripped medium wash, ripped black, washed black and light gray wash (my favorite).</li><li>A&F All Day Comfort Stretch Denim for a softer and stretchy feel.</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/09/gray-jeans.jpg><p>Call her daddy?</p><p>I never knew the difference between mom and dad jeans, but now I’m glad I do and that I have both in my closet. The High Rise Dad Jeans are more of a straight-leg pair, where Mom likes to hug curves a bit more. They also have a looser fit, which is fine if you choose your actual size or even one smaller than normal, even though the A&F Vintage Stretch Denim won’t stretch out too much.</p><p>Since they do have a baggier men’s-like fit, I like to pair them with a tighter top to get some curves going — also of note if you prefer booty-loving jeans or a skinnier leg to tuck into boots. For the shorties among us, this pair doesn’t come in the extra short length. On my 5’3” frame, this was fine, but it may not be for anyone shorter than I.</p><ul id=block-c4e5d92d-5825-4496-b716-4a79e8c9077b><li>I got a size 32, one size higher than normal for a more comfortable fit in the waistband.

This pair might be a good compromise between the generations and they do come in a bunch of colors and varieties of distressed and ripped.</p><p>Since these are super skinny, they are made of the more stretchy A&F All Day Comfort Stretch Denim, in order to mold to your curves without feeling stiff or uncomfortable. With this fabric, I did have to wash them after fewer wears to re-shrink them back to size, but this can also be remedied by ordering your normal size.</p><ul id=block-116dedcf-c448-43cb-8d06-2bf8a2d2037c><li>I got a size 32, one size higher than normal for a more comfortable fit in the waistband.

Since they are less stiff, I love these for a day of running errands or a night out, as you won’t feel the waistband digging into you as they morph into a second skin throughout the day.</p><ul id=block-ac10893e-d7fe-4c15-8d0b-eb3a6a57337b><li>I got a size 32, one size higher than normal for a more comfortable fit in the waistband.
