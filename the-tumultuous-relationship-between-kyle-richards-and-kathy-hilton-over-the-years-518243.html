In the end, Kathy said that she was in a state of shock over their limo fight.</p><p>Then, “Paris and I watched that. It was interesting.” During Sirius XM’s “Lunch With Bruce” podcast in October 2021, she said that “we broke down.” Because I was crying, I started shaking. My lips started quivering when I said “my mommy’s not there and no one is.” Paris, too, was in tears.</p><p>During the show, Kyle and Kim went through a lot of ups and downs. Kathy’s relationship with the Little House on the Prairie alum hit another bump when their husbands had a business disagreement.</p><p>“My husband has worked for my brother-in-law for years.” He then went out on his own, like everyone else does, Kyle said on an episode of RHOBH in 2018. She was referring to Mauricio Umansky, who started The Agency in 2011 after working for Rick Hilton for more than 10 years. You might not be able to get along with your family if you do that. My sisters are very important to me, and I care a lot about them, so It’s a lot of work.</p><p>The film American Woman, which Kyle started making in 2015, was partly based on their late mother, Kathleen Richards. When the show aired in 2018, she said that one of the things that made her relationship with Kathy bad was because of the show.</p><p>Kathy and Kyle haven’t talked in six months because Kyle was working on American Woman. Kyle said this on the season 8 reunion of RHOBH. “I told her all the time, I said, “I’m not going to share your stories or Kim’s stories. These are my own stories.” So, not only that, but it’s also a fictionalised version of our lives, and our mom being a single mom in the ’70s is the point of start.</p><p>After a long time apart, Umansky said in October 2019 that the whole family was back together.</p><p>“We’re fine.” His answer to Inman when he was asked about Kathy’s husband: “We’ve made up, we’re family.” They have come up with a plan together. A year ago, we were fine. We were in a fight for a while. It was real. They have made up and the event was great. We’ve been good for a long time now.</p><p>In the next year, Kathy started filming RHOBH as a “friend,” and in the 11th season, fans learned more about the family.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>If Kathy’s mom was still alive, “Kyle and I have had our ups and downs,” she said in 2021. “We wouldn’t have thrown ourselves out. It was frustrating because I think I could have had a platform if I wanted one, but I chose not to speak out about it. We started to put the pieces back together a few years ago. This is what we did. I made her a birthday dinner at home. It dawned on me that I was missing out on a lot of things when it came to my nieces. Sisters should not fight with each other, and they should not fight at all. It broke my heart, and my husband could see that.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeknbJuwNSmrKWspaTCtHnRnqOarJmku7S0yKlkm52krLKmuoyksKWdXae2pLTAq5usZZGjsW63wK2fsmWYnrm1u81mpq%2BdomLBqbGMspyaqqNignKEkW1qaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./10120132-diego-maradonas-stolen-1986-world-cup-golden-ball-trophy-to-be-sold-at-auction.html><span>←</span><span>Diego Maradona's Stolen 1986 World Cup Golden Ball Trophy to Be Sold at Auction | News, Scores, High</span></a>
