In fact, so much so, she couldn’t preach that night at Moore’s “Breaking The Rules” conference at his Experience Church in Chesapeake, Virginia.</p><p>“The fact that I’m getting ready to go and stand in somebody’s pulpit who’s seen my underwear, I’m sorry people, I just felt naked and I still do and just felt so violated,” she explained.</p><p>In his response, Moore said he truly respects Bynum and was honored that she was going to preach at his conference. But he’s incredibly let down that she took her issue with him to social media.</p><p>“Through miscommunication, misunderstandings and a Facebook Live post, the details and frustrations have been made public,” said Moore. “We want to be the first to apologize for any misunderstanding, miscommunication, disrespect and offense. We always operate from a place of excellence.”</p><p>“We are saddened and heartbroken that it has played out the way it has,” he added. “We are heartbroken that her offense was aired on Facebook as opposed to an in-person conversation or over the phone.”</p><p>The pastor’s wife Minister Kenya L. Moore spoke after that to offer clarity of the situation. She also shot down a rumor that the pastor planted a camera in Bynum’s room.</p><p>“Today we want to refute those allegations as they are personally and professionally offensive, derogatory and highly unacceptable,” said the pastor’s wife about all of the allegations.</p><p>She then said that before Bynum arrived, the pastor went into Bynum’s room with hotel staff to ensure everything was up to par.</p><p>At some point, Pastor Moore entered the “hallway of the suite” without realizing Bynum had already checked in, and he saw luggage in the main room. So he called out to see if anyone was inside, didn’t get a response and left immediately after.</p><p>Kenya L. Moore said Bynum’s belief that her husband saw her underwear came from a conversation that took place between the hotel manager, Bynum’s assistant and Bynum herself.</p><p>“This is absolutely not true,” she stated.</p><p>The pastor’s wife also said she would’ve loved to explain this all to Bynum but never got the chance to. At the end of the video, Pastor Moore said that he still spoke highly of Bynum at the conference even though she didn’t attend.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZpKGur8DAm6Oam5uowaK%2BjZympmdiZX56e49wZmtwX6m1qr%2BMoqpmmZKovK3B056jsmWepMFuwNGunGaokajBsL6Mo6ahpl2Weq67zqucZpmemXq4tcWeZKyolZa4brvUrWSanqSav2621JqloqyRYq%2B6utSmZJqbk6rApr%2BMoaCmZZ%2BberSxxKKloGWYmr9uwc2dnKuvlZa%2FcA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./go-to-an-event-like-the-oscars-say-html.html><span>←</span><span>Go to an event like the Oscars say</span></a>
