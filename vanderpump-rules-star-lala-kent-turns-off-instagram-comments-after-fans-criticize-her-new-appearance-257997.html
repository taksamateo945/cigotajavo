After the 29-year-old and her future husband posted a photo of the two of them, people pointed out that the stiffness in her face makes her look older.</p><p>“Lala you were such a pretty girl when you first joined the show. I don’t understand what happened. Hollywood changed you like it does everyone else.”</p><p>“Is it just me or does her smile look extremely stiff like she can’t move… she did post about getting fillers and I think she over did them.”</p><p><a href=# rel=nofollow>https://www.instagram.com/p/Bu-QBCMl6OD/</a></p><p>“Smh… such a pretty girl destroyed by plastic surgery. FILLERS ARE FOR OLDER WOMEN WHO NEED TO FILL IN WRINKLES not women in their 20’s and 30’s who want the ‘LA LOOK’ it just makes you look like you’re in your forties.”</p><p>The Bravolebrity also uploaded an older photo of herself where viewers of ‘VPR’ continued to berate her for her changed looks.</p><p>That’s when she decided to turn her commenting feature off and slam the critics in her Instagram Story.</p><p><a href=# rel=nofollow>https://www.instagram.com/p/BvFsowIl7b6/</a></p><p>“It’s so crazy to me what people are willing to write on other people’s photos. Like comments that are like ‘OMG you used to be pretty.’ It’s like, how bout this? You were never pretty.Does that feel good?”</p><p>She continued to say that she doesn’t criticize other people for their appearance and that social media makes everyone feel like their opinion matters when it doesn’t.</p><p>The actress goes on to thank Instagram for the feature that allows you to turn off comments and block rude people.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Kent ends her rant by showing love to the people who spread positivity. What do you think about Lala’s speech?</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGemlrulsdGprKaoXafCrbHSZqqtmaJiuaK4wGainqakYsG2vs2sZKielmK2r7%2FTmp6rmZ1isLC5zJ6lratdlrO1sdFmnZqmo2Kws7XTopqispVitaa%2BjKecsGWRpb2mrdGapZydXWeCeIWYcGY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./monique-calls-out-oprah-for-being-a-hypocrite-for-these-many-reasons-366344.html><span>←</span><span>Monique Calls Out Oprah For Being A Hypocrite For These Many Reasons</span></a>
