She could not help but get emotional as she talked about her boy.</p><p>“There’s one person here that knows you know, you know there’s no place like home right. A little burning food in oven, time to run-up to the grocery store, let’s go. Just mom. Thank you, Kevin,” The Wendy Williams Show host expressed.</p><p>iHeartRadio host Elvis Duran and CEO Of Fox Television Stations Jack Abernethy, spoke fondly of Williams and her accomplishments in the entertainment industry.

Listen, I slipped and called you fans only because I’m in Hollywood and I think I’ve gone Hollywood, but you’re not fans. That’s a stupid word. I’ve always called you Wendy Watchers. When you listened on the radio, I told you I love you for listening and now I tell you I love you for watching. You are Wendy watchers and without you, none of this would be going on,” said the 55-year-old.</p><p>It seems not a day can go by without Williams making headlines, especially this year when her life has been in turmoil.
