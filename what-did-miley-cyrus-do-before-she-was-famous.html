She is the daughter of Billy Ray Cyrus, an established country singer, best known for his number 1 hit “Achy Breaky Heart.” For this reason, Miley Cyrus was accustomed to fame from a young age. She became known to the public in her own right, after becoming the title character on the Disney Channel series </strong><strong>Hannah Montana. </strong><strong>Now, she’s an award-winning singer.</strong></p><p>Keep reading to learn more about the early life of Miley Cyrus, and how she got her music career started.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The Beginnings of Miley</h2><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Miley Cyrus</a> was born Destiny Cyrus on November 23, 1992, in Tennessee.&nbsp;</p><p>The singer had a rough start to life since she was born with supraventricular tachycardia, a condition that causes an abnormal heart rate.&nbsp;</p><p>Her father is country music singer <a href=# rel=noopener>Billy Ray Cyrus</a>. Her mother is&nbsp; Leticia “Tish” Jean Finley who works as a manager for her daughter.</p><p>The name “Miley” came about because the <a href=# rel=noopener>baby Cyrus was so smiley</a>, and this was eventually shortened to “Miley.” The singer officially changed her name in 2008.</p><p>Miley has two younger full siblings—<a href=# rel=noopener>Braison</a> and daughter <a href=# rel=noopener>Noah</a>. She also has two half-siblings though her mother’s previous relationships—<a href=# rel=noopener>Brandi</a> and <a href=# rel=noopener>Trace</a>, and one half-brother through her father—<a href=# rel=noopener>Christopher Cody Cyrus</a>.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram"></figure><p>As a kid, Miley wanted to act. She saw Mamma Mia! When she was 8 and <a href=# rel=noopener>told her dad</a>, “This is what I want to do, daddy. I want to be an actress.”&nbsp;</p><p>She got her taste of acting when she had a small role in her father’s television series <a href=# rel=noopener>Doc</a>. After, she started having singing and acting lessons at the <a href=# rel=noopener>Armstrong Acting Studio</a> in Toronto.</p><p>She then auditioned for <a href=# rel=noopener>Hannah Montana</a>, when she was 11 years old. She actually auditioned for the part of the title character’s best friend but was asked to go for the main part instead.&nbsp;</p><p>Producers initially <a href=# rel=noopener>told her</a> she was too “young and small,” but the young Miley ended up getting picked anyway because of her impressive singing and acting skills.</p><p>Hannah Montana premiered in March 2006 and had the highest viewership ever recorded in the Disney Channel’s history to that date. It became an instant success, and Miley was <a href=# rel=noopener>labeled</a> a “teen idol.”</p><p>Miley even released music as “Hannah Montana,” which was a hit among her young audience.&nbsp;</p><p>Due to the success of her music career as Hannah Montana, Miley signed a four-album recording deal with <a href=# rel=noopener>Hollywood Records</a>, to release music with her real name.</p><p>She released a two-disc album, titled <a href=# rel=noopener>Hannah Montana 2: Meet Miley Cyrus</a> in 2007. One disc in the set was the second soundtrack of Hannah Montana. The second was tracks released with the real singer’s persona.&nbsp;</p><p>The same year, Miley took off on a nationwide tour (with one Canadian event) titled “<a href=# rel=noopener>Best of Both Worlds Tour</a>.”</p><p>The company in charge of selling the tickets remarked that they had not seen a level of demand like it since The Beatles or Elvis.</p><p>Miley released the album <a href=# rel=noopener>Breakout</a> in 2008, which topped the chart.</p><p>In 2009, Miley released an EP titled <a href=# rel=noopener>The Time of Our Lives</a>. She described the album as “a transitioning album […] really to introduce people to what I want my next record to sound like and with time I will be able to do that a little more.”</p><p>Her lead single from the EP, “<a href=# rel=noopener>Party in the U.S.A.</a>” went on to become one of her most popular songs of all time.&nbsp;</p><p>She became the fourth best-selling female artist according to Billboard in 2009.</p><p>Now that more than a decade has passed since her unprecedented new-found fame, and despite a huge transition from the Hannah Montana sweetheart we thought we knew, Miley Cyrus has proven she’s here to stay.</p><p>Listen to her 2020 banger “Midnight Sky” below.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo63NrK6eqqNjsLC5jrCfmqxdmbalecyio56xXZjGs8HSZpuoZZKas7C%2BxGaqoZ1drK60ecWapKito2Q%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./he-will-be-happy-also-waka-flockas-mom-deb-hits-back-after-fans-seemingly-celebrates-waka-and-tammy-riveras-breakup.html><span>←</span><span>He Will be Happy Also: Waka Flockas Mom Deb Hits Back After Fans Seemingly Celebrates Waka</span></a>
