His father is known for films like True Romance (1993), Metro (1997), Dr. Dolittle 2 (2007) and many more. He has also held main roles on the small screen and with over 100 credits in both film and television series, Michael Rapaport is obviously one of the most popular Hollywood stars and this fame has rubbed off on Julian Ali Rapaport.</p><p><strong>Summary of Julian Ali Rapaport’s Bio</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Full name:</strong> Julian Ali Rapaport</li><li><strong>Gender:</strong> Male</li><li><strong>Date of birth:</strong> 2000</li><li><strong>Julian Ali Rapaport’s Age: </strong>23 Years Old</li><li><strong>Ethnicity:</strong> Jewish</li><li><strong>Nationality:</strong> American</li><li><strong>Marital Status:</strong> Single</li><li><strong>Julian Ali Rapaport’s Parents:</strong> Michael Rapaport and Nichole Beattie</li><li><strong>Siblings:</strong> Maceo Shane Rapaport</li><li><strong>Famous for:</strong> being the son of Michael Rapaport</li></ul><h2><strong>How Old is Julian Ali Rapaport?</strong></h2><p>Julian Ali Rapaport is 23 years old as he was born in the year 2000. His exact date of birth was not shared by his parents at birth and it has remained so to date. He was born in Los Angeles, California, to celebrity parents Michael Rapaport and Nichole Beattie. He is from a Caucasian background and inherited Jewish ancestry from his father. Julian grew up with a younger brother – Maceo Shane Rapaport.</p><p>Growing up was not a bed of roses for Julian as many would expect for a celebrity kid. His parents divorced when he was just seven years old and his mother got custody of him and his brother. However, he now lives with his father and his wife, Kebe Dunn.</p><p>There is no information on the schools Julian attended for his early education. The same applies to his college education but he is reportedly done with his studies.</p><h2><strong>What Does Michael Rapaport’s Son Do For a Living?</strong></h2><p>While his parents have carved out remarkable career paths in the entertainment industry, it is yet to be seen what career choice Julian will make. At 23 years of age, he is yet to follow a career path, which is most likely because he has not made such information public. It is believed that he should be holding down a job at his age, but it doesn’t seem to be in the entertainment industry like his parents.</p><p>So far, Julian Ali and his brother have not shown any sign of becoming actors like their father. Michael, on the other hand, is not one to force them into the entertainment industry. He is allowing the boys to make their own choices in life.</p><h2><strong>Julian Ali Rapaport’s Parents Were Married For Seven Years</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/10/The-Walking-Dead-writer-Nichole-Beattie-with-her-ex-husband-and-True-Romance-actor-Michael-Rapaport..jpg><p>Julian Ali’s parents were married from 2000 to 2007. The former couple never revealed the details of their dating days but their union became public knowledge when they tied the knot on January 15, 2000. The marriage looked peaceful from the outside but it later emerged that things were not really as they seemed.</p><p>Beattie filed for divorce in 2004 on the grounds of irreconcilable differences but there was no further explanations. The marriage was officially dissolved in 2007 with Beatie taking major custody of the kids due to their tender age. She has remained unmarried to date but on the other hand, Michael Rapaport found love again in the arms of actress Kebe Dunn whom he married in 2016, 9 years after his divorce from his first wife.</p><p>Despite their divorce, Michael and Beattie found a balance between handling their career challenges and raising their sons. In an interview with Dr. Phil, Michael revealed that even thoug he doesn’t spank his children as a means of discipline, he has other ways of teaching them to be behave. From what is obvious, his method of instilling discipline in the kids worked well as they have grown into responsible young men with no scandal trailing their paths.</p><h3><strong>Both Parents are in the Show Business Together</strong></h3><p>Both parents of Julian Ali Rapaport are active in Hollywood in different capacities. While his mother, Nichole Beattie, is a screenwriter and producer, his father, Michael, is an actor and comedian.</p><p>Born November 19, 1976, Nichole Beattie is the less popular one, mostly because she works more behind the scenes. She has been writing movies for TV and cinema since January 2005 and some of her most popular works include The Walking Dead, Sons of Anarchy, The Bastard Executioner, Rubicon, Prime Suspect, and For All Mankind. Beattie has gone ahead to land award nominations such as Producers Guild of America Award for Best Streamed or Televised Movie.</p><p>On the other hand, Michael Rapaport – born March 20, 1970, is an American actor and actress who started his career in the early 1990s. Micheal has spent decades in Hollywood and he has a lot to show for it. He has recorded more than 100 credits across the small and big screens respectively. On the big screen some of his popular works are True Romance (1993), Higher Learning (1995), Metro (1997), Cop Land (1997), Deep Blue Sea (1999), The 6th Day (2000), Dr. Dolittle 2 (2001), Big Fan (2009), and The Heat (2013).</p><p>Michael is also popular on the small screen with television in popular productions like Friends (1999), The War at Home (2005–2007), Boston Public (2001–2004), My Name Is Earl (2007–2008), Prison Break (2008–2009), Justified (2014), and Atypical (2017–2021).</p><p>Beyond acting, Rapaport has made some directorial attempts. He directed the 2011 documentary Beats, Rhymes & Life: The Travels of A Tribe Called Quest. The documentary chronicles the journey of the eponymous hip hop group A Tribe Called Quest. He is also the host of the I Am Rapaport Stereo Podcast and has contributed to several othe podcasts.</p><p>Michael Rapaport’s exploits in the film industry has made him wealthy with a net worth estimated at $8 million. The fortune extends to Julian and his brother who has not lacked the better things of life since they were born.</p><h3><strong>Meet Julian Ali Rapaport’s Brother</strong></h3><p>Julian Ali has one sibling from his parents, his brother whose name is Maceo Shane Rapaport. The younger brother of Julian was born on April 23, 2002, in the city of Los Angeles, California. This means Julian is two years older than his brother.</p><p>Like his older brother Maceo’s early life details, including the schools he attended have been kept private by his parents. He, however, spent his formative years in Los Angeles and was just five years old when his parents divorced. He is now staying more with his father and brother after spending his early years with his mother following the divorce.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapa%2FHr7XGnqmimV6YvK571KxmsKCfYra0ecmuo6KZnmKurbWMq5ipmaCkv7V5zKKaoZmVoXqzrc%2Bap6iqpKh6tLvNaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./saundra-powell-obituary-1940-2022-bountiful-ut.html><span>←</span><span>Saundra Powell Obituary (1940 - 2022) - Bountiful, UT</span></a>
